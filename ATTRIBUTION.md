## Runtime dependencies

Installed by the package manager rather than vendored; declared in
`pyproject.toml`. Licenses below are as reported by the distributed package
metadata.

### Copyleft — affects redistribution of built binaries

| Component | License |
| --- | --- |
| PyQt6 | GPL v3, or a commercial license from Riverbank Computing |
| PyQt6-QScintilla | GPL v3 |
| PyQt6-Qt6 (bundled Qt libraries) | LGPL v3 |

The PyInstaller bundles produced by `make` / `cwled.spec` embed PyQt6 and Qt.
Distributing those binaries means distributing GPL/LGPL components, which is
consistent with CWLed's own GPL license but requires that the corresponding
source offer and license texts accompany the release artifacts.
